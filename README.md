Welcome to the wonderful world of Catan.

This is a multiplayer online version of the game Settlers of Catan where you have the ability to either play your friends or your friends and an AI. All of the imports are at the tops of the files and there are none that you need to install from outside python's built in modules so all you need is a working version of some Python3 and you will be able to run the game.

Running the game:
1: go into the catanServer.py, catanClient.py, and saveme.py, files and change the HOST variable at the very top to a string of your I.P. address. You can find this by google searching "what is my IP address"
2: after doing this run catanServer.py
3: now you must decide whether you want to play with just your friends or with your friends against some AI
4: if you want to play with just your friends simply have yourself and each of your friends run the catanClient.py file. NO ONE ELSE RUN THE SERVER FILE THAT IS RUNNING ON YOUR COMPUTER, ONLY ONE PERSON RUNS THE SERVER. Once in create a user account and password and enjoy the world of Catan.
5: if you want to play with an AI you and all of your friends must first run your catanClient.py files. After you are all in the wait screen or lobby you run saveme.py it is important this file is run last. Once it has been run press play with AI to initialize the AI and enjoy a game of settlers of Catan.
** Remember this is at most a 4 player game so only 4 people can play it at a time so either you and three friends or you and two friends and the AI can play it at a time at most.
6: once you are done just x out of the game in the top left and press control-c as long as it takes for the processes to get cancelled. Usually takes about 3.
