# Settlers Of Catan
**Catan** is a online multiplayer AI version of the classic game Settlers of Catan

## How to Play
1. go into the catanServer.py, catanClient.py, and saveme.py, files and change the HOST variable at the very top to a string of your I.P. address. You can find this by google searching "what is my IP address"
2. run catanServer.py by entering 'python3 catanServer.py' in your terminal
3. decide whether you want to play with just your friends or with your friends against AI
4. if you want to play with just your friends simply have yourself and each of your friends run the catanClient.py file by entering 'python3 catanClient.py' in your terminal **Careful** only one person (you) runs the server file
5.  if you want to play with an AI you and all of your friends must first run 'python3 catanClient.py'. After you are all in the wait screen or lobby **you** run 'python3 saveme.py' *it is important this file is run last*
6. Sign up/in and enjoy the wonderful world of Catan
7. To end the game press the x in the top left then 'control-c'.
